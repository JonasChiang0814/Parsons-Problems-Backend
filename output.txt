  "prompt": "Kanye West has been known to tweet frequently, often garnering significant engagement. Use scikit-learn to find the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between the number of likes and retweets on Kanye's tweets. You have access to the following dataset: `kanye_tweets.csv`, which has three columns: `tweet`, `likes`, `retweets`. After loading the data, split it into training and testing sets. Then, use the NMI evaluation metric to compute the NMI score between the actual number of likes and retweets and the predicted number of likes and retweets.",
